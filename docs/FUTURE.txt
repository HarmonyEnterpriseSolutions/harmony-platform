Logic refactoring
-----------------

* Value of field must not be affected until entry begins loosing focus.
	+ this works in table now
	+ this is good for java clinet

* Focus handling by gui? GUI only tells logic where to put logical focus.
	- But what about next-block?

* display handlers is only for text completion
	text masking?


* make platform independent automaton. wx.masked is very bad

* ability to call any server functions with future automatic transaction commit
	- now creating datasource and block and this block calls function on every refresh

* refresh any block on the form separately

* move checked tree state and selected table state to block level

* actions is logic for toolbars, menues, buttons


Rewrite
-------

	[SQLAlchemy sql]

	|           ^
	| query     | 
	|           | ins, update
	V           |
	
	[Datasource]
		creates [Recordset of Record]

			Record
				.checked boolean
				.data tuple
				.newdata list = None 


	[Block of Field]
		- types




	Triggers:
	    
	    Form
			ON-STARTUP          Form is about to start, logic is not valid, but parameters are
								used to set datasource parameters

			ON-ACTIVATION		
		
			PRE-INSERT
			PRE-COMMIT
			POST-COMMIT

			PRE-EXIT			

		Block
			ON-NEWRECORD		Used to calculate initial values. TODO: must be called after block activated

			
			POST-FOCUSIN		Row has been changed	(used few times, POST-ROWCHANGE must be used instead)
			POST-REFRESH		Block data was reloaded
			POST-ROWCHANGE		Current row or some values of curenct row may changed, (= POST-FOCUSIN + POST-REFRESH)

			POST-FOCUSOUT		Used to save field value in global variable for future form activation

			RECORD-ACTIVATED	Enter or Doubleclick on record
			RECORD-CHECKED		Record (un)checked

		Field

			POST-CHANGE			Logic value has been changed from gui

		PopupMenu
			PRE-POPUP
			ON-POPUP

		Calendar
			DAY-ACTIVATED
			GET-CELL-TEXT
			PERIOD-CHANGED

		Button
			ON-ACTION			Deprecate it, replace this triggers with form actions.

		Entry
			ON-CUSTOMEDITOR
			ON-MENUPOPUP
